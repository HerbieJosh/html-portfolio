   <p>Thank you for taking the time to look at this basic and rudimentary website I have created.
    This is to become what i have known as a long time coming as a transition from my current employment into a 
    whole new career field. I am excited for the opportunities that are ahead and welcome every challenge as it unfolds as
    I have in my current career, as a roadie for the artist <b>Bruno Mars</b>

Chuck Norris is the reason why Waldo is hiding. Chuck Norris lost his virginity before his dad did. Chuck Norris doesnâ€™t read books.
